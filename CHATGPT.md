PHASE1B_DOWNLOAD_STABILITY_FIX_STABLE
==================================================

STATUS:
STABLE CHECKPOINT

SUMMARY:

Historical Binance download completed successfully, but the session had many WinError 10060 timeout pauses and large delays.

ROOT CAUSE:

Network / Binance HTTP timeout instability during large historical downloads.

Not RDM.
Not dashboard.
Not replay formulas.
Not research formulas.

FILE CHANGED:

tools/generate_binance_historical_replay.py

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

* REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS increased from 120 to 150
* MAX_RETRIES increased from 10 to 15
* RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS changed to:
  [10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 180, 240, 300]
* Added RETRY_JITTER_FACTOR = 0.30
* Added specific WinError 10060 detection
* Added longer recovery backoff for WinError 10060
* Added CLI flags:
  --max-retries
  --timeout
* fetch_agg_trades_batch_with_retries now returns:
  (batch_or_none, retries_used)
* download_agg_trades now tracks session_retries
* Resume loading now deduplicates partial trades by aggTrade ID
* Added checkpoint progress log every 25 batches:
  trades downloaded
  current timestamp
  last aggTrade id
  session retries
  elapsed
  ETA
  checkpoint file
  partial file
* Added final download verification:
  total trades
  first timestamp
  last timestamp
  duplicate trade IDs
  partial file path
  checkpoint file path

IMPORTANT NOTES:

This does not change:

* RDM formulas
* Replay logic
* Dashboard logic
* Research mapping
* Scoring
* Lifecycle logic
* BUY/SELL logic

This is a downloader stability-only patch.

VALIDATION:

PASSED:
python -m py_compile tools/generate_binance_historical_replay.py

CLI help confirmed new flags:

* --max-retries
* --timeout

RECOMMENDED NEXT DOWNLOAD COMMAND:

python tools/generate_binance_historical_replay.py --start "YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00" --end "YYYY-MM-DD 23:59:59" --symbol BTCUSDT --row-size 500

FOR UNSTABLE NETWORKS:

python tools/generate_binance_historical_replay.py --start "YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00" --end "YYYY-MM-DD 23:59:59" --symbol BTCUSDT --row-size 500 --max-retries 25 --timeout 180

==================================================
ZONE TERMINOLOGY CLARIFICATION
==================================================

STATUS:
LABEL CLARIFICATION ONLY

Formation Range != Active RDM Zone != Density Band

Definitions:

* Formation Range = old Preparation Zone = broad context range from preparation_low_price / preparation_high_price.
* Active RDM Zone / Interaction Core = compressed operational zone inside Formation Range.
* Density Band / Interaction Heart = narrowest interaction concentration inside Active RDM Zone.

Dashboard label policy:

* Visible labels should not call preparation_low_price / preparation_high_price an entry zone.
* preparation_low_price / preparation_high_price should display as Formation Range (broad context).
* Active operational width should display as Active RDM Zone / Interaction Core Width.
* Narrow interaction concentration should display as Density Band / Interaction Heart Width.

Clarification:

Formation Range is broad context, not entry zone. Operational decision zone is Active Core / Density Band.

Rules:

No formula changes.
No replay changes.
No research changes.
No B12v2 changes.
No scoring changes.
