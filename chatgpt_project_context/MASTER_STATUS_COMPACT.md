# Master Status Compact

## Current Stable Status

The project is at:

PHASE1B_STREAMING_REPLAY_STABLE

This checkpoint adds an additive, opt-in `--stream` flag to
`tools/generate_binance_historical_replay.py`: a bounded-memory
rebuild path for long, continuous, multi-month windows. It does not
change any RDM formula, scoring, lifecycle, or Synthesis logic.

Prior checkpoints (not all individually detailed here — see git log /
CURRENT_CHECKPOINT.md "Prior Checkpoints"):

## Streaming Replay Refactor (`--stream`)

`tools/generate_binance_historical_replay.py`:
- New flag `--stream` (default off; old path byte-for-byte unchanged
  when absent).
- New reader `stream_cached_day_trades()` — yields aggTrades from the
  Tier-1 raw-trade cache one UTC day at a time (O(one day) memory).
- New consumer `run_streaming_pipeline()`:
  - Persistent `tick_buffer` across day-file boundaries, flushed only
    at `row_size` (500 ticks) — never at a day seam.
  - ONE continuous `StatisticsEngine` / `RenkoEngine` / observation
    state for the whole window.
  - Warmup primed via `deque(maxlen=500)`, tick_buffer reset at the
    warmup -> target boundary.
  - Incremental CSV writes for market-rows and observation-rows.
  - Row-count invariant assertions (`rows == ceil(target_trades/500)`,
    non-final rows have `tick_count == 500`) — raises on violation.
  - V1/V2 replay events/episodes + archiving reuse the existing
    (unchanged) functions, fed by re-reading the observation CSV.
- `--save-raw` is not supported together with `--stream`.

STATUS: Stages 1-2 implemented and additive-verified (compiles, 0
deletions, old path unchanged). **Stage 3 (April byte-identical sha256
equivalence test) is PENDING** — not yet confirmed by Lamri. Treat
`--stream` as experimental until that passes.

## What Phase 1 Now Produces (carried from prior checkpoint)

Every zone case produces one MarketInterpretation:

```
context:        regime + confluence + flow direction
structure:      trajectory + confidence + health state
engagement:     visits + omega class + force balance
flow:           direction + intensity
prediction:     HOLD / FAIL / UNCERTAIN / NO_PREDICTION + confidence
coherence:      STRONG / MODERATE / WEAK / INSUFFICIENT
interpretation: one sentence (max 80 chars)
```

Output file: research/zone_synthesis.csv

NOTE: the exact row/column counts and prediction distribution recorded
in the prior PHASE1B_SYNTHESIS_ENGINE_STABLE checkpoint (276 rows, 13
columns) predate the March/April/May generalization and B12v2 work —
do not treat those numbers as current without re-checking
research/zone_synthesis.csv.

## Completed Phases / Modules

- Dashboard V2 statistical layer (9 layers, confluence scoring)
- Historical replay infrastructure (3-tier hybrid downloader + Tier-1
  raw-trade cache + new bounded-memory streaming path)
- Phase 1B Episode Research Assistant
- RDM Market Mechanics V1.1 through V1.5
- RDM V1.6-A Numerical Foundation
- RDM V1.6-B1 through B11 (full attacker + exposure + structural
  prediction series)
- Phase 1 Synthesis Engine (connects all layers into one coherent
  output)
- Downloader stability (Tier 1 cache / Tier 2 ZIP / Tier 3 API
  fallback)
- B12 / B12v2 prediction validation, Formation/Active Core zone
  geometry work (see CURRENT_CHECKPOINT.md prior checkpoints)

## Validated RDM Physics

sigma x penetration vs omega: r = 0.9935
Structural engagement chain: Force -> sigma_barre filter -> Penetration -> Omega -> mechanical_family -> Growth or Damage
Surface Damage hypothesis: REJECTED (temporal decay formula, not market physics)

## Next Steps

Priority:
1. Confirm Stage 3 streaming equivalence (April sha256 byte-identical
   check) — see RUN_COMMANDS.md.
2. If PASS: discuss making `--stream` the default and running the
   126-day (2026-02-01 -> 2026-06-06) continuous rebuild.
3. Re-run B9-B12v2 / Synthesis on the unified rebuild once produced.

Do not:
- Enter Phase 2
- Add execution / entries / exits / BUY / SELL
- Change Dashboard V2 scoring
- Change RDM formulas
- Change lifecycle logic
- Use `--stream` output for research datasets before Stage 3 passes
